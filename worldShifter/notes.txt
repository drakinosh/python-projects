-After hours of grueling labour, I have succeded in making a half-decent UI
-Just realised that I had, in the past, terminated some sentences in this note
 with a semicolon;
-Changed all folders to packages so importing from sibling and child
 directories is possible, thus eliminating redundant modules

To-do:
-Need to add further features to editor such as deletion of items, inserting
 identical items in a row easily e.g. holding shift to create a row of plat-
 forms
-Need to add enemies more intelligent than slimes with healthbars if their
 own
-Need to make the levers actually do something useful, like opening a gate
-Need to add extra functionality
-Need to re-read previous notes, as I seem to have forgotten what I had 
 wanted to add in the past

 PS: Am downloading 'Sakamichi no Apollon' and have played Portal
 PPS: My madness actually starts from today. I will make AI a reality, or 
      die trying. There is no turning back.
 PPPS: I should really add a readme file.
